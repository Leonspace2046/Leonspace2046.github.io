        <p><strong>Geralt of Rivia</strong> has arrived, and with tough quests and a limited time to complete them, players are struggling to catch on. Here's how to get ahead of the rest and complete them early.</p>
        <img width="1335" height="700" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-geralt-of-rivia-quests-1920x1080-4a94e265a299.jpg" alt="the rewards you will gain for the geralt of rivia quests. will be revealed.">
        <p>The first quest is activate 5 different augments in different matches. You cannot do 5 augments in the same match. To do it quickly, jump off the Battle Bus as soon as possible and wait for an augment to be available. Apply any augment, leave the match and repeat until you have done it 5 times in 5 different matches. When you have done this, you will be able to claim a Geralt of Rivia Loading Screen.</p>

        <p>The second quest is Complete 3 Bounties. You can do this fast in Team Rumble as you can gain the help of many teammates and also be able to respawn. Here is a map of all the Bounty Boards on the Island.</p>

        <p>And here is a picture of what a Bounty Board looks like:</p>

        <p>For completing 3 bounties you will receive the Muscle Memory Spray.</p>

        <p>The third quest is Defeat a Boss. Again, this can be done easier in Team Rumble as you can respawn and you have the help of your teammates. For completing this quest you will get the Weapons of the Witcher Back Bling.</p>
        <img width="1335" height="700" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-xeGdVUTXFA/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="The Weapons of the Witcher Back Bling is kind of like a bunch of swords and a crossbow bunched into one.">
        <p>The fourth quest is emote in the Cidatel Throne Room. Simple enough, but beware, because there is a chance that the Ageless Champion will spawn here. For doing this quest you will get the Igni Sign emote.</p>

The character also has a slight look of concentration on their face.">
        <p>The fifth quest is deal melee damage to opponents. Thankfully, to complete this quest, you don't have to use your Harvesting Tool. You can use the Shockwave Hammer to do it too. For doing this quest you will get the Witcher's Steel Sword Harvesting Tool.</p>

        <p>The fifth quest can be done with no effort at all. Once you complete all the other Geralt of Rivia page 1 quests, you can instantly claim the fifth reward. The fifth reward is the Geralt of Rivia himself.</p>
