            <p>The Fortnite v23.40 update will go live today, and even during the downtime, half of the update has been leaked already. There has been talk about many new Exotic Weapons, and many exciting, fan favourite unvaulted weapons. These unvaulted weapons will see the return of the The Hop Rock Dual Pistols Exotic, The Heavy Sniper Rifle, The Exotic Boom Sniper Rifle and much more.</p>

            <p>There might also be something called Biome Events, which we have no information about except for its name. The reliable leaker hypex has suggested that it could be similar to the tornado event we had in the last chapter.</p>

            <p>We might also get a Captain America/Sam Wilson bundle in the Item Shop and Captain America/Sam Wilson collab.</p>
