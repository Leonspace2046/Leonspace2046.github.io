        <p>Epic has released free items before, but we don't see them release a free whole pack very often. But proof is right in front of our eyes.</p>

        <p>This Quest Pack will give you an Outfit, a Pickaxe, a Back Bling and a Wrap. Unfortunately, these amazing rewards do not happily travel in a car down to a nice holiday in your Locker, at least not until you earn enough Levels. Yes, to get these items, you must Level Up. You will earn a reward every 10 Levels, up to 50 earned Levels while you have this Quest Pack. Hurry, though, as (at time of writing) you only have about 11 weeks to earn the 50 Levels.</p>
