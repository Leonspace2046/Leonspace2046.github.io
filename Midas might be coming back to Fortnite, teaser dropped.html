<h1>Midas might be coming back to Fortnite, teaser dropped</h1>
<p>Midas died to a shark attack in Chapter 2 Season 3. Epic recently sent this tweet:</p>

<p>See the coicidence? Midas is on the beach, along with many other fortnite characters. Then they all look up in horror and the screen goes black. This a)means people will die b)means Midas will have a moment soon or c)means something else, or Epic sent it just for fun. Plus, there's another related ongoing. In the v22.40 update, Epic Games added 2 new hair styles for a skin called...well dressed spy. Odd that they added hair styles when there's a rumour that Midas will appear in the live event, and that Midas had a fasion sense of the highest standard.</p>
