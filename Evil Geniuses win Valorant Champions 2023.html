        <p style="font-size: 20px;">This is VERY late, but Evil Geniuses have won the <strong>Valorant 2023 Championship.</strong> To be honest, I kinda expected it to be a win for Fnatic since their sniping is just something ELSE, but Derke was having a TERRIBLE day and EG pulled through to win.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Overall, a REALLY interesting Championship. Team Liquid getting ACED on, Paper Rex winning against NRG... the Sunset Map coming out... really interesting Championship. Good Game everyone.</p>
