<p>To enter this Creative Island, go to the section to change game and then go to "Island Code". Then put in the map code 1487-3213-6612 and then enter. Make sure you set it to Private Game.</p>
<h1>Step 2: Interact with the AFK XP button</h1>

<p>When you spawn on the island, you will see weapons. Look beyond that, though, and you will see a vault with a green button beside it in the corner of the map. This, however, is not the AFK XP button. It is the XP shop button. Run over to the XP shop button and interact with it. You will then be teleported to a room. Turn right and head into the area with tomatoes with faces, then interact with the AFK XP button. You will then begin to get XP.</p>
<h1>Step 3: Interact with 2 more buttons</h1>

<p>After interacting with the AFK XP button, go back to arena. Then build 9 floors behind the matchmaking portal and interact with the invisible button. Watch the video above for additional information.</p>
