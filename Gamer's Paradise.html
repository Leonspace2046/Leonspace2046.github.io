<h1>WELCOME</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Gamer's Paradise! Here you should find tips for many games. The first game we're going to be talking about is Among Us, the second game is Roblox, The third game is Minecraft, and finally, the fourth game is Fortnite.</p>
<h1>AMONG US</h1>
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://cdn1.epicgames.com/salesEvent/salesEvent/amoguslandscape_2560x1440-3fac17e8bb45d81ec9b2c24655758075"

`<p>Among Us has been updated with a new map, and you can also bee an engineer, guardian angel or scientist now (plus crewmate and impostor.). It's probably a good idea to experiment with all the maps to get to know the tasks, best hiding places and vents. In Among Us, when the impostor/s kill a crewmate, a crewmate might report the dead body or the impostor could self-report. When a dead body is reported, the game pauses and everyone can try to find out who the impostor is by spreading information in the chat box. When you've come to a decision or when time is up, you will have to vote. If you are unsure of who to vote, you can also press the skip. If you find out who the impostor is or you have crucial information, you can go to the cafeteria and do an emergency meeting, which is basically like dead body reported. The crewmates' objective is to finish their tasks and/or vote out the impostor. The impostors' objective is to kill all the crewmates.</p>
<h1>HOW VOTING OCCURS</h1>

<p>Unlike other games, Among Us doesn't really have secret doors or portals to hidden areas or any other thingymubajugs. Though if you search up "Among Us on YouTube, there are all sorts of weird stuff, such as Among Us vs zombies, real life Among Us, LOADS of hacks and glitches and many, many more. You can do that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=among+us" target="_blank">HERE.</a></p>
<p>You can get Among Us <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/" target="_blank">HERE.</a></p>
<p>So, we've NEARLY finished our Among us section, but we need to finish with a burst of Among Us videos. Did I mention that I have a YouTube channel? It's called Leon's Space. You can check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwO-fYW6GG4VtqyaipLCiGQ/videos" target="_blank">HERE.</a></p> <p>Ok, now it's time for Among us vids! One of them is my only Among Us video and was taken when I was TERRIBLE at being a YouTuber...</p>

<h1>ROBLOX</h1>
<img width="560" height="315" src="https://cdn.appuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d66ae37d46e00a1ecacfe9531986690a.jpg">
<p>I haven't included a video for Roblox yet because what many people don't realise is that Roblox is like a massive amusement park. It has MILLIONS of games, all in one game. If you're new to Roblox, why don't you come up with an epic avatar? On the Roblox home page, look at the different icons. There's home, discover, a picture of your current avatar and a dot dot dot icon. Press on the picture of your avatar. Now select either customise or shop. If you want to just change your avatar, go to customise, and if you want to buy different accessories, jumpers, outfits and far, far more, go to shop. Most of the items in the shop cost Robux, Roblox's in-game currency. You can buy Robux on the online Robux shop (will explain later) or you can top up with a Roblox gift card, available at many toy shops' gaming section (e.g. Smyths Toys Superstore). Once you've come up with a good avatar, it's time to get started!

<p>The video you just viewed was made in a game called pet simulator X, one of the most popular Roblox games, known for crashing Roblox during updates because too many people attempted to join. Because there are too many Roblox games, I can't really guide you through every single one. But what I WILL do is give you a list of the most popular Roblox games. Games you might want to check out(many of which I, weirdly, don't really like),:
Pet Simulator X, Brookhaven, Adopt Me!, My Restaurant!, BIG Paintball!, Epic Minigames, Bot Clash! and Welcome To Bloxburg.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many, many more popular games, but these games are enjoyed by the majority of the communit, and you might like too!

<h1>MINECRAFT</h1>
<p>NOTE: This Minecraft guide is for complete beginners only. If you are experienced, skip the whole Minecraft section.</p>
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x5GaA4GkehF4fUQjTExNoZ.jpg">
<p>Minecraft is a fun building/surviving videogame. You can choose to join a server with other players or you can create your own world to survive/build in. There are three Minecraft dimensions: The Overworld, The Nether and The End.</p>
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-srwCRCAA_KQ/YS9z7_jIB8I/AAAAAAAAXsQ/0BBsl2oeSPc_7jsxL5e0QeQi_sXikrLCQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/bff.webp">
<p>The first image is The Nether, the second image is The Overworld, and the third image is The Ender Dragon in The End.
The Overworld iss where you spawn. You could spawn in an Overworld cave, village, desert, beach, random place with trees and tons more. The first thing you wanna do is cut down some trees. Now go to your inventory and craft four oak planks, like this:</p> 
<img width="1335" height="800" src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2021/01/c697f-16100143091311-800.jpg">
<p>Now craft those four oak planks into a crafting table like this:</p>
<img width="1335" height="800" src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2020/12/6adbb-16087203408772-800.jpg">
<p>And then put that crafting table in your inventory. From now on if you need to craft, use the crafting table, because you can hardly craft anything in your inventory.</p>
<p>Now what you should do is craft a wooden pickaxe. Chop down some more trees and craft more oak planks. Now use your oak planks to craft a stick by doing this:</p>
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/minecraft/3/31/StickRecipie.png">
now get your oak planks and sticks and to this:

<p>Now dig down for minerals and craft stronger and better tools and armour! This is only to begin.

<h1>FORTNITE</h1>
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/21br-metaimage-lineup-1920x1080-44acd5f27136.jpg">
<p>At the time at writing this section, it's currntly chapter 3 season 3, but it's 1 month away from season 4. Fortnite Vibin' is here, casting a chill aura around The Island. However, the Imaginary Order (Or The IO,) still might not be completely wiped out. To learn more about the IO, click <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Imagined_Order#Overview" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<h1>The Battle Pass</h1>
<p>The Battle Pass in Fortnite usually costs 950 vBucks, Fortnite's in-game credit. (To get vBucks, you can buy them from the in-game vBucks section, buy a git card at the gaming section of stores like Smyths, or claim them from the free section of the battle pass, that you still need to level up to claim. More on vBucks later.) However, INSIDE The Battle Pass has an amount of vBucks between 1000 and 1200. You can use vBucks in the in-game shop, which has skins, bundles, emotes, back blings, gliders, and more! However, unlike other games, these products do not improve gameplay. The only way to improve your skill is to practice. If you buy The Battle Pass, you'll be using tons of battle stars, so try to get to a high level before buying it. The higher the level, the faster you can claim further pages! The Battle Pass has a selected amount of every type of product from the in-game Fortnite shop, which makes it a pretty good offer.</p>
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/fortnite_chapter_3_battle_pass_28.jpg/BROK/resize/1200x1200%3E/format/jpg/quality/70/fortnite_chapter_3_battle_pass_28.jpg">
<h1>vBucks</h1>
<p>vBucks can be aquired, as explained earlier, from the in-game vBucks section, buy a gift card at the gaming sections at stores like Smyths, or claim them from the free section of the battle pass. No matter what websites tell you, vBucks CANNOT be aquired for free, so don't give away any personal information.</p>
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://cdn1.epicgames.com/fn/offer/EGS_2800VBucks_1920x1080-1920x1080-eb673b1a86e31de680720a1a35446f04adf987ea.png">
<h1>The Dragon Ball Update</h1>
<p>In The Dragon Ball update, There were two new mythics added: The Kamehameha and The Nimbus Cloud.</p>
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/goku-kamehameha-dragon-ball-fortnite-nimbus-cloud.jpeg">
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Fortnite-Kamehameha-Nimbus-Cloud.png/BROK/thumbnail/1600x900/format/jpg/quality/80/Fortnite-Kamehameha-Nimbus-Cloud.png">
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/679/6794662/4021826-dbz.jpg">
<p>The Kamehameha is good if you need to shoot an opponent who is hyperactively building and moving. The Nimbus Cloud is good for getting away from a battle you think you'll lose.</p>
<p>Along with the Dragon Ball Update, A Dragon Ball Adventure Island game was added in <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/exploring-the-discover-screen-in-fortnite-creative" target="_blank">Discover.</a></p>
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4023282-1.jpg">
<p>In the Dragon Ball Adventure Island, you can do PvP in a special arena where you will have a Nimbus Cloud, Kamehameha and a gun. There are also bottles scattered in plain sight across the map. Each bottle nets you 38 XP. You can also fly around on a Nimbus Cloud onto a cloud.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTw4iMMlkQA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>That video should explain the quests.</p>
<h1>Star Wars</h1>
Star Wars was added in Fortnite. There were two new weapons: The E-11 Blaster and Darth Vader's Lightsaber, both of which are mythics. 
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://static1.millenium.org/articles/5/39/21/25/@/1606835-horreur-fall-guys-scie-pnj-corni-arme-article_image_t-2.jpg">
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/06/b938e-16565868063992-1920.jpg">
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJy6JSvZJ9Qthje4YbfmkB.jpg">
<p>The E-11 Blaster can be obtained by opening Imperial Chests in the Imperial Docking Bays. There are five Imperial Docking Bays in total, and they are located in the yellow circles of the following image:</p>
<img width="1335" height="700" src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Finding-Imperial-Chests-In-Fortnite-Chapter-3-Map-Locations.jpg">
<p>Imperial Chests not only include the E-11 Blaster, they also have random legendarys and epics. However, if you enter an Imperial Docking Bay, the chances of you getting attacked by Darth Vader and/or  Imperial Stormtroopers are higher than any other location on the <a href="https://fortnite-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Royale_Map" target="_blank">Island.</a></p>
Darth Vader's Lightsaber cannot be obtained from Imperial Chests, so the only way to get Darth Vader's Lightsaber is to kill Darth Vader or to kill someone who has already done so. If you're trying to kill Darth Vader, You should probably get an E-11 Blaster or an even better weapon. Darth Vader can throw things at you with The Force, use The Force to bring you to him, Force-choke you and block your bullets. The only place where he can't block bullets is his head, which also happens to be the place for a critical shot. You can still shoot at his body and he still will take some damage. Darth Vader is also flanked by two Imperial Stormtroopers.
