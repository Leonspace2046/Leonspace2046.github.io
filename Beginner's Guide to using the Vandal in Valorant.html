        <p>The <strong>Vandal</strong> is one of the most popular Valorant weapons, sice it can one tap headshot anyone in practically every range. A lot of people trying out the Vandal, though, are using it absolutely wrong.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Vandal has 3 main shooting options: The tap, the burst and the spray. The tap is the one used most often, followed by the burst and the spray.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Vandal is at its best at one tap headshots, so one of the mistakes a lot of people make is crouch spraying. Not only will this mess up your aim, It doesn't actually help that much when using the Vandal. So you just have to place your crosshair on the head and fire. Of course, this is easier said than done, but there are some little tricks to make it easier.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first trick is sensitivity. Hop into the shooting range and change your sensitivity until you have a sensitivity that fits you. If you're overflicking, change your sensitivity lower. If you're underflicking, change your sensitivity higher. There are incredibly elaborate tutorials on YouTube too.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The second trick is your crosshair. You need something similar to <strong>TenZ's</strong> crosshair. Not to big, not too small.</p>
