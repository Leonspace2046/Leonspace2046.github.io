        <p>There are different types of <strong>Fortnite bans</strong>. A ban is when you cannot play Fortnite for a certain amount of time. This happens when you do something that <strong>Epic Games has either banned or does not approve of</strong>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The worse the thing that you have done is, the longer you will get banned. Some actions will result in a <strong>permanent ban.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>To prevent being banned, do not do anything that will give you an unfair advantage that is undesired by Epic, or use any technology or softwares that will impact the game or do something like give you aimbot. One of the examples of forbidden technology that could result in a ban is the <strong>Cronus Zen and Cronus Max</strong>. These will let you get advantages like bot lobbies and less or no recoil. You can also code your own cheats to give yourself an even bigger advantage. If you use it, you will recieve a message telling you to unplug the Cronus Zen, Cronus Max or any other banned technology and to restart Fortnite. If you choose to ignore this message, it can result in a permanent ban.
