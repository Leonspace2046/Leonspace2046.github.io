        <h1>Breeze coming back to competitive in Valorant after map changes</h1>
        <img width="1335" height="700" src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2023/08/6b793-16923799854715-1920.jpg" alt="Breeze map in Valorant">
        <p><strong>Breeze</strong> is one of the most disliked maps in Valorant because of its big bomb sites and large rotations when playing on Attack. You can dominate most major areas and Defence is forced to scurry around the edges of the site, getting picked easily.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Due to this issue, <strong>Riot Games</strong> has been forced to remove it from Competitive to fix these issues and try to even out the sides.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Luckily, Riot has addressed this and has made an official announcement saying that Breeze will return at the start of Episode 7, Act 2.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your stay in paradise has been upgraded. At the start of Episode 7 Act 2, Breeze will return to the map rotation with a few changesâ€”Fracture and Pearl will rotate out. Preview the changes below: <br><br>- Mid Pillar and Mid Cubby <a href="https://t.co/rpgNyXv3r9">pic.twitter.com/rpgNyXv3r9</a></p>&mdash; VALORANT (@VALORANT) <a href="https://twitter.com/VALORANT/status/1692552055267717144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>They have also shown the changes that they have made so far. The biggest changes here seem to be to A Halls and A main.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">- A Hall and Mid Wood Doors <a href="https://t.co/2noJZWsWHu">pic.twitter.com/2noJZWsWHu</a></p>&mdash; VALORANT (@VALORANT) <a href="https://twitter.com/VALORANT/status/1692552116936565009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>There is a downside, however. Riot has announced that to make space for Breeze, they will have to remove Fracture and Pearl. Now, keeping in mind that Riot always keeps 7 maps in the competitive possible maps, there is a rumour that there will be a brand-new map, being released at the <strong>Valorant Championship 2023 Finals.</strong>To read the full story, click <a href="./VALORANT teases 2nd new map in 2023.html">here.</a> So, overall, do you think this will be worth it?</p>
