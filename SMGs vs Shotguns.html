<h1>Close-Range</h1>
<p>Close range combat is a very often occurence in Fortnite. One of the most favoured close-range combat weapons are shotguns.</p>

<p>Shotguns are good because they fire in bursts, spreading out. that means even if your aim is bad, you will still probably get a hit. If you do a headshot or hit an opponent's body, it will hit very hard.</p>

<p>Shotguns were actually WAY stronger than they are now, but then, Epic decided to nerf them. They gradually nerfed shotguns over the time of 18 seasons. Somehow, shotguns have still been able to remain one of the best close-range weapons possible, but lots of players still complain about how they are supposedly terrible.</p>

<p>Shotguns are VERY common though. There are tonnes of different shotguns in Fortnite, and most shotguns don't actually even have a legendary or epic version, which makes them suprisingly easy to find.</p>
<h1>SMGs</h1>
<p>SMGs are weapons that can rival shotguns for the rank of the best close-range weapon. Even though they have a low base damage, they can shoot very quickly which gives them a fairly high DPS. They also have a very high ammo capacitity. One of my personal favourite quick-fire weapons is the Suppressed Submachine Gun. (The Stinger SMG isn't bad too.</p>

<p>The Suppressed Submachine Gun is silenced. Any weapon that has "Suppressed" in it is, so it's very good for sneaking up on people! Of course, the same applies for other people, so always listen in battle! You could hear the reload of a gun, or hear someonbe switching between guns. And also remember, if a fight seems hopeless, don't continue. Just run away as fast as you can.</p>
