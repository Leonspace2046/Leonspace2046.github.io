        <p>The OG Fortnite Submachine Gun returned about 2 months ago, and I realized that I haven't made a post about it yet. Here are the basic principles of the OG Fortnite Submachine Gun:
            <br>
            1.It has 30 ammo in its magazine, and reloads surprisingly quickly.
            <br>
            2.The crosshairs aren't very tight, so it's best for close-range combat.
            <br>
            3.Its damage is also quite good for an SMG.
