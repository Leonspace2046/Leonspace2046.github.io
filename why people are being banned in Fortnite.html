    <p>With the release of Chapter 4, Fortnite players have been exposing all kinds of <strong>glitches</strong>. One of the most sought-after, though, are <strong>XP glitches</strong>. XP glitches will allow players to get XP, often more than you could usually get. Surprisingly, Epic hasn't been doing much about XP glitches, but then a few days ago some players recieved a ban from Fortnite for about 1 day.</p>

    <p>Players were banned because of a Discord bot they used, which allowed them to play any Limited Time Modes, and as many times as they wanted. It also allowed players to gather infinite <strong>Slap Berries</strong>, which give XP every time you pick them up. However, Epic found out about this glitch and banned the players who used the Discord Bot for about 1 day.</p>
    <br>
    <p>According to users of this Discord Bot, it wasn't even worth it. The users of the Discord Bot got banned for about 1 day and only got about 1 level.</p>
