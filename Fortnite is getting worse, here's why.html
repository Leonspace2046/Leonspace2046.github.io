<h1>Fortnite is getting worse, here's why</h1>
<p>Fortnite is getting worse for beginners. They vaulted the Pump Shotgun, but that's back now. They also nerfed the shotguns, and they were a noticeable beginner choice, as accurracy wasn't too big of a problem. Now they've added super OP weapons like the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/fortnite-kamehameha/" target="_blank">Kamehameha</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/fortnite/where-find-nimbus-cloud-fortnite-chapter-3-season-3" target="_blank">Nimbus Cloud.</a> The Kamehameha launches a ray of blue towards its target, nearly definitely killing it's target. This is a very bad for beginners, as it does estimated 2000 damage. The Nimbus Cloud is great for making a quick getaway, launching you into the air and allowing you to glide on a yellow cloud.</p>

<p>Also, there's a possibility that mechs will return to Fortnite. A mech just smacked <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Slone" target="_blank">Doctor Slone,</a> and she's already presumed dead. The good news is, Fortnite has added bots. And the bad news is, Fortnite's added bots. Bots were added to Fortnite because the game was often too hard to win if you were, say, a level 10 and you were playing against level 300's. The better you get, the less bots you'll be playing against. And the bad news. Not really bad, but lots of players hate having to play against bots. Don't ask me why, I hate the thought of playing against bots and I don't even know why.</p>
