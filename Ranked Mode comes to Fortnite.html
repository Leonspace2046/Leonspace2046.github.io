        <p><strong>Ranked Mode</strong> will be coming to Fortnite on March 16. I am writing this on the night of March 15, so it is coming out tomorrow. Many games, such as Apex Legends or Call of Duty have a <strong>Ranked Mode,</strong> so Fortnite Fans have been demanding one for a while now. Epic has decided to grant this request, but details right now of the <strong>Ranked Mode</strong> are very vague. Apparently, Ranked Mode will be like Rocket League's Ranked/Competitive Mode, where you will come closer to ranking up if you win, and the same or further if you lose. Now, since there are about 100 people in your average Battle Royale, it will be likely that if you place #1st, you will become greatly closer to ranking up, but if you place #50 or below, you will become further from Ranking Up. Ranked Mode can be turned on in settings. If you turn it on, people with the same or similar rank as you will be in your match. If you are in a party, on the other hand, match members will be about or the same rank as the person in the party with the highest Rank.</p>
