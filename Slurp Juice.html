        <p><strong>Slurp Juice</strong> may used to have been an Epic rarity heal, but it has recieved an update. It now restores up to 200 health or shields, but it is now legendary. This heal has already become a fan favourite, with many pros gulping one down just before a fight or when in the storm.</p>
