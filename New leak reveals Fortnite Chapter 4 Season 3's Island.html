        <p>As you probably already know, NPCs on the Fortnite Island are feeling shakes, perhaps an earthquake, presumably from Mega City's impact. Well, according to a recent tweet, the island will crack, and new POIs will rise, in a certain... GREEN fashion.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite Season 3: EXOTIC<br><br>Jungle Zero has risen from the Island&#39;s cracks and has altered its landscape drastically.

        <p>As you can see from the tweet, this will be known as Jungle Zero, and the season's theme/name will be "EXOTIC." Since there are leaks about a brand-new racing car mode, similar to <em>Mario Kart,</em> which may even have an entire new Battle Pass for it, it is likely that this will be a great Season.</p>
