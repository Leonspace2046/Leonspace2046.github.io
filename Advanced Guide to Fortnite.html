    <h1>Building</h1>
    <p>The most popular kind of building is probably Cranking 90s. It involves placing 2 walls, a ramp and a floor.</p>

    <p>I use a different type of the '90s. You can learn it in the following video.

    <p>Most people choose to just build a simple wall during combat. There is a very good reason for this, as lots of people don't care about taking the high ground, they just attack. I once cranked 90s during a combat situation, and my stairs were immediately destroyed.</p>
    <p>If you try to shoot someone in a Battle Royale, they'll probably build around themselves for cover. If this happens, chech their build. If they've fust simply placed 2 or 3 walls and a roof, you could run to the are in the build where there's no cover and then shoot your opponent. This is usually quite useful, as you'll probably take them on by suprise and they also might be using meds and shields. But if they've build all-round cover, you'll have to break down the build.</p>

    <p>Okay, since you're on the ADVANCED Guide, I presume that you already know the four basic building shapes: walls, cones, stairs/ramps and floors.</p>
    <p>Quick summary: wood is the weakest material to build with, buit it finishes the fastest, they're most easily found in forests and lots of unnamed and remote places. Brick is the most medium-est material to build with, and it's most easily found in urban areas. Metal is the strongest material to build with, and it's most easily found in urban areas.</p>
    <p>If you're combat-ing, you could do a messy kind of build. For example, you could build any amount of walls around you, then jump and place stairs under you. Then you could place any amount of floors in any direction, spamming walls as you do so,etc.</p>
