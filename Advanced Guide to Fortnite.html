    <h1>Building</h1>
    <p>The most popular kind of building is probably Cranking 90s. It involves placing 2 walls, a ramp and a floor.</p>

    <p>I use a different type of the '90s. You can learn it in the following video.

    <p>Most people choose to just build a simple wall during combat. There is a very good reason for this, as lots of people don't care about taking the high ground, they just attack. I once cranked 90s during a combat situation, and my stairs were immediately destroyed.</p>
    <p>If you try to shoot someone in a Battle Royale, they'll probably build around themselves for cover. If this happens, check their build. If they've simply just placed 2 or 3 walls and a roof, you could run to the area in the build where there's no cover and then shoot your opponent. This is usually quite useful, as you'll probably take them on by suprise and they also might be using meds and shields. But if they've build all-round cover, you'll have to break down the build.</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>Okay, since you're on the ADVANCED Guide, I presume that you already know the four basic building shapes: walls, cones, stairs/ramps and floors.</p>
    <p>Quick summary: wood is the weakest material to build with, but it finishes the fastest, they're most easily found in forests and lots of unnamed and remote places. Brick is the most medium-est material to build with, and it's most easily found in urban areas. Metal is the strongest material to build with, and it's most easily found in urban areas.</p>
    <p>If you're combat-ing, you could do a messy kind of build. For example, you could build any amount of walls around you, then jump and place stairs under you. Then you could place any amount of floors in any direction, spamming walls as you do so,etc.</p>
    </p>

    <div class="bottom-left"><em>This is a more neat messy build... messy builds are in The Pit FFA. Map code 4590-4493-7113.</em></div>
    </div>
    <p>If you're looking out for how to break an enemy build, however, what lots of people don't do is look for a piece/s of that build that would cause the whole structure to topple. For example, remember the example of how to messy build that I just told you about? All you have to do is break the floor/s, preferably at the bottom. Think about it. the floors are what's holding the walls up, and the wall's what's holding the stairs up, and the stairs is holding up the next section of build. So if you break the floor, it'll topple the wall, breaking the stairs, and so on and so forth.</p>

    <h1>Weaponry</h1>
    <p>Obviously, there are weapons in Fortnite. Some places naturally have more loot than others, like Tilted Towers would have more loot than most unnamed areas. But most players know that, so chances are, if you go to somewhere like Tilted Towers or Coney Crossroads, It will be very hard to survive. Often 2 or more players will go into the same building as each other and would have to fight with weapons or their harvesting tool.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>Since there are only five inventory slots in Fortnite Battle Royale, choose your loadout wisely. You should have a long range weapon, a medium range weapon, a close range weapon, whatever you want and med items. Some weapons are better than others at, say, long range. Two-shot shotguns, for example, are very good for short range, but absolutely terrible for long range. On the other hand, Striker Burst Rifles may be very good for long and medium range, but are terrible for short range. The more you play Fortnite, the better understanding you'll have for seeing which weapons are good for what.

    <p>I know this has been a very short guide, but it... ends here.                                                       Umm... the videos should be here now.                                    I said, THE VIDEOS SHOULD BE HERE NOW! Oh yeah. I've got a YouTube Channel called Leon's Space, which you can view <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwO-fYW6GG4VtqyaipLCiGQ/videos">here.</a></p>
