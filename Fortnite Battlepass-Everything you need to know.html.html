<p>The Fortnite Battlepass is part free, part not free. There are only 3 things on each Page if you don't use vBucks, (Fortnite's in-game currency,) and you also won't get any good stuff like skins and skin styles. There are only ten Pages in total, and to get to page ten, you need to be level 100 unless you use vBucks and claim the specific amount of rewards needed to unlock the Page. So if you don't use vBucks, that means you reaching level 100 for just 30 rewards, and plus the rewards aren't very good.</p>

<p>In the image above, the 3 on the left side of the Page are the rewards you can get for free. If you buy the Battlepass, though, it will usually cost 900 vBucks, but have 1000-1200 vBucks inside, letting you buy the next seasons' Battle Pass if you keep most of it. Most players don't do this though, and considering all the loot inside the item shop, it's understandable why.</p>
