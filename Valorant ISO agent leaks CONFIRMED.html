        <p style="font-size: 20px;">There has been leaks for a new agent in Valorant for about 2 weeks now, and a couple of days ago it has been officially confirmed by Riot Devs on the Valorant Discord Server that ISO will be coming out in <strong>Episode 7, Act 3,</strong> which is releasing on October 21, 2023, AKA Halloween.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Storytime&#39;s over.<br><br>Iso, VALORANTâ€™s newest Duelist Agent from China, joins us in Episode 7: Act III. <a href="https://t.co/1z5dbPgXUj">pic.twitter.com/1z5dbPgXUj</a></p>&mdash; VALORANT (@VALORANT) <a href="https://twitter.com/VALORANT/status/1715019983745585412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">This agent from <strong>China</strong> has pretty cool abilities. I'm going to recap them all here.<br> The <strong>Signature Ability</strong> for this agent is pretty good. If you activate it, it starts a window of time that's similar to <strong>Jett's,</strong> who had a nerf on Patch 7.04, which you can read about <a href="./Valorant destroys Jett on Patch 7.04.html" target="_blank">here.</a> It's much longer though, and if you kill a player during this window of time, you absorb the next bit of damage, including Raze's Ultimate, Showstopper. The C ability conjures a wall similar to Harbour's, but is not breakable by anything, which has INSANE potential on Attack Rounds. The Q ability makes a circle like omen's blind but is faster and smaller and applies Vulnerability insted, causing all damage taken by the player to be doubled for a short duration. The ult gets you and a targeted player in a 1v1. What do YOU think of this agent?</p>
