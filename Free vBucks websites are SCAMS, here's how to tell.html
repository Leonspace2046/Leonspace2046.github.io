<h1>Free vBuck websites are SCAMS, here's how to tell</h1>
<p>Free vBucks sound too good to be true, do they? Well, they are! Over 4,700 "Free vBucks" websites are on the internet trying to trick players! ALL of these websites are SCAMS! EVERY SINGLE ONE.</p>

<p>Free vBucks are NOT POSSIBLE. If one WAS possible, besides, some YouTuber would upload it to YouTube and Epic Games (The team that created Fortnite) would find out about it eventually and patch it. All these websites are trying to do is to steal your personal information. Also, the bit where you have to put in your username is just to make it more believable. You will find that even if you put in a fake username such as "habdsjkdhsandjsnbdjhfcfj", it will still say "user found." I will show 5 pictures below that describes what happens.</p>
<h1>Step 1: The user puts in their username. (I put in a fake username, (ur mom this is so fake 2,)) see what happens on step 2.)</h1>

<h1>Step 2: Even though my username was fake, it says user found.

<h1>Step 3: The fake vbuck generator demands you to do 1 of several things.</h1>

<h1>Step 4: Once you click on something, it asks if you have a PAYPAL ACCOUNT.</h1>
