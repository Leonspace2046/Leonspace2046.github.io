        <p><strong>Fortnite Chapter 4</strong> is out now. With a couple of new weapons such as the <strong>Thunder Shotgun,</strong> it looks like we're in for a fun Chapter.</p>

        <p>After the <strong>Chapter 4 live event,</strong> people are talking about a possibility that MrBeast might come to Fortnite. Near the end of the live event, when <strong>The Paradigm</strong> was looking out at everything that the <strong>Zero Point</strong> had pulled in, you could see MrBeast being pulled in, and the camera even closed up to him and pulled away really quickly. He was also floating above a biome with lots of trees, so that could possibly be a reference to when he planted 1 million trees.</p>
