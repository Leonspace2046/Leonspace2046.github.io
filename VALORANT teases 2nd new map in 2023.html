        <p><strong>Riot Games,</strong> sometimes just called Riot, has sent a teaser on Twitter for <strong>Valorant's</strong> 2nd new map this year, the 1st being <strong>Lotus</strong>(personally one of my favourite maps, excluding Haven and maybe Pearl). The teaser is enclosed above.</p>
        <br>
        Some people <em>already</em> have theories (why am I not surprised?) and I recently found this one, which is actually logical.

        <p>Passing on from the fact that we practically saw Cypher use his OWN tech on Deadlock to spy on her (lol) This is quite interesting. As the video mentioned, further information will be revealed on August 26, which happens to be the Valorant Champions 2023 finals. Wouldn't it be cool if the finals were played on the new map? (FYI, this probably won't happen since teams have to practice maps and pick maps.)</p>
